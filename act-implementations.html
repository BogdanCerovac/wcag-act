<h1 id="top">Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Implementations</h1>
 
<p><strong>Status: DRAFT 1 July 2019</strong></p>
 
<p>This page tracks implementations of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/">Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0</a> for the Candidate Recommendation (CR) phase.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AGWG)</a>, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/">Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force</a> documents at least <strong>@@@ test rules</strong> meeting the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-act-rules-format-1.0-20190416/#Exit_Criteria">'Exit Criteria' of the ACT Rules Format 1.0 CR specification</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>@@@</li>
  <li>@@@</li>
  <li>@@@</li>
  <li>@@@</li>
</ul>

<p>This set of test rules was developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/act-r/">W3C ACT Rules Community Group (CG)</a>, with review, involvement, and other contribution from a broad representation of the community, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access42</li>
  <li>Accessibility Foundation</li>
  <li>Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (Difi)</li>
  <li>British Broadcasting Corporation</li>
  <li>Cyxtera Technologies Inc.</li>
  <li>DAISY Consortium</li>
  <li>Deque Systems Inc.</li>
  <li>IBM Corporation Inc.</li>
  <li>Level Access</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
  <li>Siteimprove</li>
  <li>Universidade de Lisboa</li>
  <li>US Access Board</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to completing the <a href="https://act-rules.github.io/pages/design/review/">'Review Process' of the ACT Rules Community Group</a>, some of these test rules are used by automated testing tools and manual methodologies, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accessibility Engine, automated testing tool by Level Access</li>
  <li>@@@, automated testing tool by Cyxtera Technologies Inc.</li>
  <li>Alfa, automated testing tool by Siteimprove </li>
  <li>aXe Core, automated testing tool by Deque Systems Inc.</li>
  <li>RGAA, manual methodology from the French government</li>
  <li>Trusted Tester, manual methodology from the US government</li>
  <li>QualWeb, automated testing tool by Universidade de Lisboa</li>
</ul>

<p>The following tables list the 'Exit Criteria' that reflect the normative requirements defined by the ACT Rules Format 1.0 specification. For each criterion there is a list of test rules that meet this criterion.</p>
