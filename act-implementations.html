<h1>Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Implementations</h1>
<p>This page tracks implementations of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/">Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0</a> for the Candidate Recommendation (CR) phase.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Document results in the implementation column with a link to the rule to be used to satisfy the particular requirement and whether it passes, fails, or is in progress. Here's a few examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/rules/SC2-4-4+2-4-9+4-1-2-link-has-name.html">Links Have An Accessible Name </a> <b>pass</b></li>
  <li> <a href="https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/rules/SC1-1-1-image-has-name.html">Images Have An Accessible Name </a> <b>fail</b></li>
  <li> <a href="https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/rules/SC3-1-2-lang-valid.html">Valid Body Lang Attribute </a> <b>in progress</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>ACT Rules Format Implementations</h2>
<p>The following tables document the implementations of the various normative requirements in the ACT Rules Format 1.0. Rules must meet the <a href="/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/wiki/Exit_Criteria_for_Rules_Format_Spec" title="Exit Criteria for Rules Format Spec">exit criteria</a> for the standard to progress to CR status.  These exit criteria are also included in the Exit Criteria section of the PR version of the spec.</p>
