# WCAG Ruleset Review Process

This Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format is intended to enable a consistent interpretation of how to test conformance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and other accessibility requirements documents. The W3C is looking to establish a commonly agreed upon set of ACT Rules for WCAG, to help organisations across the field of web accessibility to produce consistent test results for WCAG. This common set is the **WCAG Ruleset**, which is maintained by the ACT Task Force.

Organisations looking to contribute rules to the WCAG Ruleset can submit rules to the ACT Task Force. These organisations are known as rule providers. The ACT Task Force will review rules that have been proposed by rule providers, and decide whether or not it can be included in the WCAG Ruleset.

When a rule is submitted to the ACT Task Force, the Task Force expects that rule to be as complete and as accurate as the rule provider can possibly make it. **Rule providers are expected to have their own review and quality assurance processes in place.**

## Proposing And Updating A Rule

When proposing a new rule, or an update to a rule, there are four steps to go through:

1. **Proposal**: The rule provider creates an issue
2. **Screening**: The ACT Task Force facilitators do an initial review
3. **Survey**: The ACT Task Force reviews the rule through a survey
5. **Publication**: The ACT Task Force submits an updated ruleset for publication

Updates to rules can only be done by the rule provider. This is to avoid creating forks, where two versions of a rule are worked on independently, potentially with conflicts. This also applies to the ACT Task Force, which can propose changes to the rule, but not put those changes in.

### Proposal

The rule provider creates an issue on the [ACT GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-act/issues). The issue must include the following information:

1. A URL to the rule
2. License of the rule
3. Information about any [implementations](#implementations)

### Screening

One member of the ACT Task Force, usually an editor or facilitator, reviews the proposal for major inaccuracies in the rule. The purpose is to avoid spending reviewer time on obvious oversights. The person screening the rule can not be involved in the original creation of the rule.

If the rule does not pass this step, one of the ACT facilitators will send the feedback to the rule provider. If changes are editorial in nature, and the rule provider can resolve those within 5 work days, the issue will be screened again straight away. If not, the proposal will be closed. Proposals can always be resubmitted, which will restart the process from step 1. This puts the proposal on the bottom of the backlog.

### Survey

A facilitator of the ACT Task Force creates a survey for the rule, in which Task Force members are asked the following questions:

- Does the rule follow the ACT Rules Format 1.0?
- Are the assumptions acceptable?
- Is the implementation data correct?
- Is the rule consistent with existing WCAG documents?
- Are there any remaining open issues for this rule that were opened prior to this review?
- Do you have any further questions or concerns about this rule?
- Do you think this rule is ready to be published?

This survey will be open for at least 5 work days, to give ACT Task Force members sufficient time to review the rule. No more than 5 rule surveys will be due in the same week.

If the rule does not pass this step, one of the ACT facilitators will send the feedback to the rule provider. If changes are editorial in nature, and the rule provider can resolve those within 5 work days, issue will be surveyed again straight away. If not, the proposal will be closed. Proposals can always be resubmitted, which will restart the process from step 1. This puts the proposal on the bottom of the backlog.

### Publication

When a rule passed the review stage, it is included in a draft version of the WCAG Ruleset. Depending on the types of changes, and the availability of the Accessibility Guidelines (AG) Working Group, the ACT Task Force decides on a timeline for releasing updates to the WCAG Ruleset. To update the WCAG Ruleset, the ACT Task Force requests approval from the AG Working Group. The AG Working Group will have its own process for deciding whether or not to publish the next version of the WCAG Ruleset. For example, AG may decide to have Call For Concensus e-mail, or a survey.

## Public Feedback

Public feedback received about the WCAG Ruleset will be processed by the ACT Task Force. These questions can either be submitted directly into the ACT Task Force GitHub repository, or be copied into Gihtub issues from questions to the ACT public mailing list.

Questions the ACT Task Force can answer will be responded to directly. Questions that may require updates to a rule will be forwarded to the rule provider, including a proposal from the ACT Task Force on how to resolve the question. If the rule provider uses the proposal without additional changes, the rule will be updated without having to go through the review process. The rule provider should still apply their own review process to the change. If a different solution is taken, or additional changes are made, the update will have to go through the review process.

For the ACT Task Force agenda, public feedback will be prioritised over review of proposed rules. This ensures responsiveness to the wider community. The ACT Task Force should respond to questions within 5 work days. This may be a reply in which they defer to the rule provider for a solution.

## Annual Review

Since technologies and standards frequently change, rules require regular maintenance. To ensure quality over time, the ACT Task Force will review every rule in the WCAG Ruleset at least once a year, to ensure it is still current and correct. If any changes are deemed necessary, the ACT Task Force proposes an update to the rule to the original rule provider. If the change is taken up without further updates, the update is accepted without review.

## Orphaned Rules

If a request for change from the ACT Task Force to the rule provider is not responded to within two months, either from public feedback or an annual review, the ACT Task Force will assume the rule is no longer actively maintained. The ACT Task Force will send at least 2 reminders before concluding the rule is not maintained. If a rule is not maintained, the ACT Task Force will look for another organisation who might be willing to maintain the rule. If the original rule provider wishes to resume maintenance of the rule, this will only be accepted with the permission of the active rule provider.

If no one can be found to maintain a rule within a month, the rule will be labelled as "outdated". Outdated rules will be removed from the ruleset after 1 year.

## Rule Provider Questions

Often when writing rules, questions come up about the intended meaning of WCAG success criteria. The ACT Task Force will keep track of such questions coming from rule providers using GitHub issues. The ACT Task Force will work with the AG Working Group to come up with answers for such questions. As response to such questions is dictated by the availability of AG, there is no target time frame for a response.

## Implementations

An implementation is either an accessibility testing tool, or a testing methodology. Implementations show that the ACT rule works in practice, and that the interpretation made by the rule is one that is used in real-world accessibility testing. Because of this, having more implementations, or having an implementation that has a lot of users weighs heavily in demonstrating that the assumptions and interpretation in the rule are acceptable to the accessibility community.

An implementation must be correct. This is determined by running the tool or methodology on the test cases provided in the rule. Acknowledging that not all implementors distinguish between "passed" and "inapplicable", and that semi-automated tools can return "cantTell" as a result, an implementation is considered correct when it gets one of the allowed outcomes for all of the test cases:

| Test Case Type | Allowed outcomes                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Passed         | `passed`, `cantTell`, or `inapplicable` |
| Failed         | `failed` or `cantTell`                  |
| Inapplicable   | `inapplicable`, `cantTell`, or `passed` |
